Modeling Data for NoSQL Document Databases,"Ryan CrawCour, David Makogon","Application developers must support unprecedented rates of change – functionality must rapidly evolve to meet customer needs and respond to competitive pressures. To address these realities, developers are increasingly selecting NoSQL document-oriented databases (e.g. Azure DocumentDB, MongoDB, CouchDB) for schema-free, scalable and high performance data storage. One of the oft-cited benefits of NoSQL solutions are that they allow for the storage of schema less data. In reality, however, NoSQL solutions provide for schema flexibility, allowing the system to store data as it comes in, permitting dissimilar structures and encouraging seamless data model iteration. While schema flexibility makes it easy to embrace changes to your data model, data modeling is still important in NoSQL systems. In this session, we’ll discuss not only modeling data in Azure DocumentDB, but also migrating and transforming data from traditional, structured data environments. <img src=""http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&amp;dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Events/Build/2016/RSS&amp;WT.dl=0&amp;WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:4b264dafdca24ba1a0b0a5da00c470c0"" />",https://s.ch9.ms/Events/Build/2016/P468,Modeling_Data_for_NoSQL_Document_Databases.mp4,http://video.ch9.ms/ch9/2eac/a7ba727a-7bfa-4f44-ab87-5a440b702eac/P468_220.jpg

Managing Secrets for Azure Apps,Sumedh Barde,"Every serious app you deploy on Azure has critical secrets – connection strings, certificates, keys. Silly mistakes in managing these lead to fatal consequences – leaks, outages, compliance violations. As multiple recent surveys point out, silly mistakes cause 4 times more data breaches than adversaries. In this session we will go over some best practices to manage your important app secrets. These may seem like common sense, yet a lot of developers neglect them. We will also go over how to leverage Azure Key Vault to implement those best practices. As an added benefit, following these practices will also help you demonstrate compliance with standards such as SOC. The first ten minutes of the session are level 100 and they apply to any cloud app you develop on any platform.

What’s New in Accessibility (for Developers and Users),Jeff Petty,"In this brief video, Jeff Petty from the Windows Accessibility Team, provides an overview of some of the new accessibility features coming to Windows in 2016. He shares information about how Microsoft is responding to user requests for a “one stop shop” for accessibility on MSDN (the new Accessibility Developer Hub) and to combine guidance and sample code in articles (the new Design &amp; UI content at the Windows Dev Center). The overview also includes XAML improvements, e.g. support for mnemonics or access keys in a few steps, and Edge platform improvements, e.g. code web pages and apps using web standards like ARIA for an accessible experience. He also shares some new tools that make it easier to find, triage and fix common accessibility errors within Visual Studio and after apps have been deployed using Narrator Developer Mode. Finally, he shares some investments Microsoft is making to improve the Narrator user experience.
